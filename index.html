            I am passionate about writing concise, efficient, testable code
            using best software development practices. As a musician, I learned
            to utilize both creativity and logic to deliver results that met the
            requirements and standards of the team I was hired by with
            professionalism, enthusiasm, and integrity.

            working environments and communicating across different backgrounds
            and disciplines.

            to learn efficiently and apply that knowledge in a wide range of
            concepts with flexibility, creativity, and precision. I'm
            continuously inspired to share knowledge with others and absorb new
            information about my craft at every possible opportunity.

          my audience, and am relentlessly driven to create well-rounded,
          streamlined products that are not only enjoyable, but meaningful to
          use.
